## An officially signed version of this apologies letter will be provided after hours. Thanks for your patience.
I apologize to all Chinese users who got offended by Anierin Bliss, a project member. We are taking this incident seriously and we will ensure that such incidents will not happen again.

Open source software should not contain any form of restrictions that block users from doing certain things. I believe that the entire content of the project should be open and available for free with no restrictive behaviors.

Nationality and political factors will not influence this project. We are working hard to ensure that the project remains neutral, stable and safe for use for everyone.

For Chinese users who got banned in our groups due to this incident, please contact @AkitoHaruka in Telegram.
